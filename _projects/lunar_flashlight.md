    Lunar Flashlight (LF) was a 6-U CubeSat originally developed at JPL that was designed to detect water ice on the south pole of the moon. GT was selected to design the propulsion system in conjunction with MSFC. After GT's initial involvement designing the propulsion system, GT was selected to integrate the spacecraft and perform mission operations. 
    
    
    I got involved with the integration and test campaign while I was finishing my undergrad degree. After being hired full-time at GTRI, I continued my work on LF, delivering the CubeSat for launch in late 2022 and performing mission operations through summer 2023.  LF ultimately failed to reach the moon, but working on this project was incredibly rewarding and a highlight of my career. This page covers my involvement with LF from it first arriving at GT in Summer 2021 to us saying goodbye in December 2023. (WORK IN PROGRESS)
