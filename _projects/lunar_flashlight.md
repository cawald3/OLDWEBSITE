Lunar Flashlight (LF) was a 6-U CubeSat originally developed at JPL and designed to detect water ice on the south pole of the moon. GT was selected to design the propulsion system in conjunction with MSFC. After our initial involvement designing the propulsion system, GT was selected to integrate the spacecraft and perform mission operations. I got involved while I was finishing up my undergrad and continued working on LF after I graduated. While LF failed to reach the moon, working on this project was incredibly rewarding and a highlight of my career. This page covers my involvement with LF from it first arriving at GT in Summer 2021 to us saying goodbye in December 2023. (WORK IN PROGRESS)
