    Lunar Flashlight (LF) was a 6-U CubeSat originally developed at JPL that was designed to detect water ice on the south pole of the moon. GT was selected to design the propulsion system in conjunction with MSFC. After GT's initial involvement designing the propulsion system, GT was selected to integrate the spacecraft and perform mission operations.  
    
    I got involved with the integration and test campaign while I was finishing my undergrad degree. After being hired full-time at GTRI, I continued my work on LF, delivering the CubeSat for launch in late 2022 and performing mission operations through summer 2023.  LF ultimately failed to reach the moon, but working on this project was incredibly rewarding and a highlight of my career. This page covers my involvement with LF from it first arriving at GT in Summer 2021 to us saying goodbye in December 2023. (WORK IN PROGRESS)

<h1> Background </h1>


<b>So why go to the moon and look for water ice at the south pole? And how do we know there's water there in the first place?</b>

Because of the geometry of certain craters on the south pole of the moon, there are areas on the south pole that have not seen sunlight in millions of years. These regions have extremely low temperatures and any water that found its way to these locations could be trapped and form deposits. There have been several missions that were designed to detect water on the moon. One of my favorite examples is the [LCROSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCROSS) mission, which smashed the upper stage of a rocket into a crater to expel a dust cloud which a second spacecraft would then fly through to measure the water content of the ejected regolith.

So while we know there is water ice on the south pole of the moon, it is still an open question of where the water ice is precisely located. Enter Lunar Flashlight. By carrying high power infrared lasers and a detector capable of measuring the reflected laser signal from the lunar surface, Lunar Flashlight could determine the distribution of the water ice in 2-D at a higher resolution than any previous mission. We had a wonderful science team for this mission and you can find a fantastic article on the instrument and the designed science mission here

<h1> Integration </h1>
<b>Putting all the pieces together</b>

We had a propulsion system that was fabricated at GT and an avionics assembly that was assembled at JPL. While both systems had undergone some system-level testing, they had never been tested as a unit. When the upper avionics assembly arrived at GT, it would be the first time **ever** that the flight systems would be connected. We had to take this from a collection of separate parts, to a fully-assembled CubeSat ready for launch in just a few months.

I was thrown into this project in June 2021, about two months before the bus was scheduled to arrive. I was responsible for writing procedures on how to assemble a CubeSat that I hadn't even seen in person yet. I spent almost every day meeting with JPL engineers and students within SSDL at GT to figure out how we were going to put this thing together. It was stressful but extremely rewarding at the same time.

The bus arrived at GT in August 2021. Our original schedule was tight as we originally thought we would be delivering LF for launch on the Artemis 1 mission. The project quickly decided though that it would be better to skip the Artemis 1 launch and give us more time to fully assembly and test the bus.
