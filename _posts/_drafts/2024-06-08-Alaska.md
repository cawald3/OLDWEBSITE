There's an upcoming mission in the Space System Design Lab at Georgia Tech called VISORS, which stands for Virtual Super-Resolution Optics Using Reconfigurable Swarms. VISORS consists of two cubesats that fly in close proximity to eachother to image the sun's corona. Operations will happen out of Georgia Tech using our ground stations.

I work on our ground stations at Tech, but in the past couple of years, we haven't had to support many missions. Lunar Flashlight was our last big mission, and that used the Deep Space Network to provide communication. VISORS is one of the first missions we've had in a while that will rely heavily on our ground stations.

However, VISORS is launching into a near polar orbit. This means that in Atlanta, GA, we would only get two ~15 minute passes each day at best -- not nearly enough to support the data downlink we need from the mission. So we're collaborating with several universities to increase our ground station coverage. The Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) and the University of Alaska Fairbanks allowed us to stick an antenna on their existing masthead up at the Poker Flats test range. Due to its geographic location, this ground station should have the VISORS satellites in its view multiple times a day. I went up in early June to get our ground station equipment set up and wanted to write a bit about the process in this post. 

## Image Slider

This is a simple image slider. It uses the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) library. Check the [examples page](https://swiperjs.com/demos) for more information of what you can achieve with it.
